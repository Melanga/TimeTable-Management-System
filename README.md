# flutter_intelij

A new Flutter project.

## INTRODUCTION

In the existing system new semester timetables are put on the notice board at the beginning of the new semester. Students and Lectures have to manually keep track on their time tables. We can replace this system with a mobile app which have more features and facilities for both lecturers and students like notifications task notifications and to-do lists. This app is optimized for weekly recurring time tables. This app is integrated with university email address for user categorization and security.
